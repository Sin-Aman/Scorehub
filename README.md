Application Concept:

A soccer notification application. The app would track score updates on live sporting events. The updates would include details such as which player scored, assisted, has been disciplined, how much time is left in the match, etc.

STAKEHOLDERS:

Any sports/soccer fan looking to keep up to date with their favorite teams or sports around the world when they cannot watch the live event.

User Stories:

1. As a user, I can receive live notifications of big soccer matches around the world.
2. As a user, I can pick my favorite teams to receive constant in-game notifications of their matches.
3. As a user, I can mute notifications of certain teams or leagues that I am not that interested in.

Requirements:

Real time notifications, logo of the team appearing as the notification appears, database to host information, usage of existing api to push notifications (twitter); set notifications for a specific twitter profile. Minimal information about the game such as: score, who scored, assist info, substitutions, disciplinary action, etc.
